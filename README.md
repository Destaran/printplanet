# PrintPlanet: The Simplest Factorio Calculator

PrintPlanet aims to combine the perks of all available calculators and even more: simple, configurable, accurate and transparent while feature rich. Most of the calculators are overcomplicated, or if not, they are not so useable. I would like to provide a calculator to my fellow engineers, that can be utilized for any challenge Factorio can bring for new players and veterans alike.
